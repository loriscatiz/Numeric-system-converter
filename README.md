# Numeric System Converter
This very simple web application allows users to input numbers in any of the following numeric systems: decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal. The application then automatically converts the input into all the other systems, providing a quick and easy way to work across these bases.

## Features
* Real-time conversion: as you type in any field, the values in the other numeric systems are instantly updated.
* Input validation: ensures that only valid characters are allowed based on the selected numeric system (e.g., only 0 and 1 for binary).
* Automatic corrections: removes invalid leading zeros and ensures consistent formatting.
* Modals: Each numeric system has an info button that opens a modal, providing detailed information about its usage and characteristics."
* Modular design: the code is structured to handle extensions and improvements easily.
